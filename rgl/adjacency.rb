# The DirectedAdjacencyGraph class implements a generalized adjacency list
# graph structure.  An AdjacencyGraph is basically a two-dimensional structure
# (ie, a list of lists).  Each element of the first dimension represents a
# vertex.  Each of the vertices contains a one-dimensional structure that is
# the list of all adjacent vertices.
#
# The class for representing the adjacency list of a vertex is, by default, a
# Set.  This can be configured by the client, however, when an AdjacencyGraph
# is created.
